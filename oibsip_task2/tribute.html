<h1>Pele(1940-2022)</h1>
<p class="p1">Pelé, byname of Edson Arantes do Nascimento, (born October 23, 1940, Três Corações, Brazil—died December 29, 2022, São Paolo, Brazil), Brazilian football (soccer) player, in his time probably the most famous and possibly the best-paid athlete in the world. He was part of the Brazilian national teams that won three World Cup championships (1958, 1962, and 1970).
  Pelé began his career at the age of 15 for Brazilian club Santos FC and quickly dazzled the footballing world with his timing, accuracy, speed, dribbling and agility.And back in 1961, when he was still around 21 years old, the government of Brazilian President Janio Quadros declared him an ‘official national treasure’ to prevent European clubs from taking him away from the country. And, then there was the historic event from 1969 when the two factions of Nigerian civil-war agreed to a 48-hour cease-fire only to watch Pelé play when he was visiting Nigeria with Santos.

  That, in a way, shows how much valued O Rei has always been from the very beginning of his career.
